                    <p>I am basically a combination of 2 hobbies; I am a pRo gAmEr and I used to be the guitarist in a band. I have a very cute (albeit kinda fat) dog back home. Her name is Tiddy and she might be the most useless dog I have ever seen. On a more serious note, I am very enthustic about all things A.I. and machine learning related and want to build my skillset to make a notable contribution to the world. (help skynet cause the apocalypse?)</p>

              <p>I started playing league of legends in 2014 and I haven't been able to stop. It is a crippling addiction that consumes me entirely to this very day. I play adc, which is probably the most hated role and I am not nearly good enough to put my rank on here. Here is a picture of my main.</p>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>I have been playing guitar for about 10 years now and I would like to thing that I'm halfway decent. For about 3 of these I worked as a freelance guitarist/member in a band. I'm very much influenced by guitarists like John Mayer, Eric clapton and B.B.King. I love the blues and I currently play an American Pro 2 Fender Stratocaster. Yes, I am that guy at the concert intensly studying the band's gear while everyone else is having a good time. (I wouldn't go with me either). I have a couple of covers on my Instagram page that you can check out if that's something that interests you :) </p>
